Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to Ruby on Rails](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the CFBD API will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change by reaching out to me via [email](mailto:admin@collegefootballdata.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CFB_Data) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Please do reach out to me via [email](mailto:admin@collegefootballdata.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CFB_Data) with any questions you may have.

Thanks!
